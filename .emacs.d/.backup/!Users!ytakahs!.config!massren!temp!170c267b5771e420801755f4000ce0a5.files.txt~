// Please change the filenames that need to be renamed and save the file. Lines
// that are not changed will be ignored by massren (no file will be renamed), so
// will empty lines or lines beginning with "//".
// 
// Please do not swap the order of lines as this is what is used to match the
// original filenames to the new ones. Also do not delete lines as the rename
// operation will be cancelled due to a mismatch between the number of filenames
// before and after saving the file. You may test the effect of the rename
// operation using the --dry-run parameter.
// 
// Caveats: massren expects filenames to be reasonably sane. Filenames that
// include newlines or non-printable characters for example will probably not
// work.
